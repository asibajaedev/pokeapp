# Pokeapp
This is my first project approaching Flutter. It is a basic encyclopedia that displays an information panel and a list of Pokémon fetched from the PokeAPI. When a Pokémon is clicked, relevant information that is not initially shown, such as its weight, height, and types, will be displayed. Its functionality is still quite limited because I consider it a first version. In the future, I will add more features that come to mind and could be interesting to implement, allowing me to continue improving my skills with Flutter.
It's important to mention that the application is designed for mobile devices. While it can be used on Windows and in its web version, certain visual modifications would be needed to make it look better in these environments.
